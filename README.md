I got the opportunity to do a mock Azure Dev Ops project for two weeks.

<h3>Scaffold pages to create/edit/delete</h3>
Scaffold Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core 

<h3>Collapse Accordion Menu</h3>
I used bootstrap to create a accordion menu that collapse open and close

<h3>Sorting</h3>
I used JavaScript to sort through inventory based on items that are damaged or not, a-z/z-a, and back to original state where newest entries are top of table.

<h3>Authorized Pages</h3>
I made the user having to do sign-in credentials to make any changes to inventory such as, create new item, edit item, or delete item. Any user that is not signed in are met with a view page that says unauthorized.

<Seed()>
I used the seed method to add an authorized user in the database to have permission to make any changes to data and set a User Name, Email and Password.
